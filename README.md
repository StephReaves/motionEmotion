motionEmotion
==============

motionemotion is an emotion & gesture-based arpeggiator and synthesizer. <br>
It uses the webcam to detect points of motion on the screen and tracks the user's emotion. It draws triangles between the points of motion, and each triangle represents a note in an arpeggio/scale that is determined by the user's emotion.
